# Fundamentals of Calculus

Imagine being able to predict the path of a spacecraft, design the next breakthrough in AI, or understand how planets move around the sun. That's the power of calculus. Far from being just an abstract branch of mathematics, calculus is the language of change and motion.

It's the key to unlocking how things evolve, whether it's the technology behind self-driving cars or the algorithms that allow AI to learn and grow. Grasping calculus means you're not just solving problems; you're opening doors to innovations that shape our world and beyond. It's about seeing the patterns in the chaos and using that insight to create a better future.

??? question "Are you interested in a brief history of Calculus?"

    Calculus, often hailed as the "mathematics of change," has a rich history woven with intellectual brilliance and leaps of innovation. Its story begins in ancient Greece, with early inklings from thinkers like Archimedes, who toyed with the idea of infinity. However, the true dawn of calculus came in the 17th century, when two towering geniuses, Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, independently developed its foundational principles. Newton, with his laws of motion and gravitation, used calculus to describe the forces that govern our universe. Simultaneously, Leibniz introduced the elegant notation that we use today, making complex calculations more accessible. Their groundbreaking work unleashed a wave of scientific discovery, from the precise prediction of celestial orbits to the fascinating algorithms behind modern AI. Calculus has since evolved, becoming a cornerstone of both pure and applied mathematics, driving progress and innovation in countless fields. This blend of historical intrigue and mathematical brilliance makes the story of calculus not just a tale of numbers, but a testament to human curiosity and ingenuity.

In this course, we will develop both a solid conceptual and practical understanding of this powerful and elegant mathematical tool.
