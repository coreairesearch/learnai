# Welcome to Pytorch and Deep Learning

Welcome to the **PyTorch Deep Learning Guide**! This documentation will guide you through the key concepts, techniques, and practical applications of PyTorch in deep learning.

## Introduction

Artificial intelligence, a term often vaguely defined, encompasses a range of disciplines that have been extensively researched and scrutinised. It has also been the subject of much confusion, exaggerated hype, and sci-fi-induced fearmongering. The reality is much more measured. It would be misleading to suggest that today's machines are learning to "think" like humans. Instead, we've developed algorithms that can effectively approximate complex, nonlinear processes, allowing us to automate tasks that previously required human intervention.
